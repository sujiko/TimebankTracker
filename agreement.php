        <h1> Terms of Service </h1>
        <p lang="en"> Hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is just a chemical
            reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard Morty then it slowly 
            fades leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents 
            are going to do it. Break the cycle Morty, rise above, focus on science.
